## What is this?

This a node.js library written in pure javascript that can be used to check if the given value is a "binary buffer". 

## Usage

You can add this library to your node.js application using node's `require()` system with the following line of code:

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var isBinary = require('{%= name %}');

console.log(isBinary('foo'));             
console.log(isBinary(new Buffer('foo'))); 
//=> false

console.log(isBinary(fs.readFileSync('some-image.jpg'))); 
console.log(isBinary(fs.readFileSync('some-image.gif'))); 
//=> true
```

## Attribution

Based on the code from [isbinaryfile](https://github.com/gjtorikian/isBinaryFile), which only reads from the file system. If the file doesn't exist, is a directory, or is empty, the function returns false.
